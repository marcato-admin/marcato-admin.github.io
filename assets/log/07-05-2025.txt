    Im liking the progress im making with this site, alot of learning going on- makes me feel like I'm getting stuff done.
    But so far my only issue is how the whole store thing works, I'm NOT paying >=$15 a month for custom domain integration or whatever it was. I dont even make $15 a month from this (yet)
    Hoping to find more things to design+sell, so far I'm thinking "ID" cards, desk-sized shipping containers, and also I need to find a way to consolidate these logs easier, so it doesnt look like BLOCKS of text over and over further down the line...
    I need to work in like 10 or so hours which is nice. I'd hope to-
actually just figured out the text thing so now its a separate text file, and its also with really small font now so enjoy.
  back to what I was talking about
   - "ID Cards"
   - Desk organizers
   - More shirts
   - Posters?
   - Maybe custom printed notebooks
  Thats enough to hold me over for a while, most of whatever time it takes will be me saving up to actually get inventory of those..
